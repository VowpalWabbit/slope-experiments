Continuous Contextual bandit experiments for the SLOPE estimator

The estimator is developed in the paper titled [Adaptive Estimator Selection for Off-Policy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07729) and this repository was used for the experiments presented in section 4. 

The repository contains a simulator for continuous contextual bandits (CB), some estimators for off policy evaluation in the continuous CB setting, and some scripts for running the experiments.
